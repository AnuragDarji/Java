# *| JDBC*
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is nothing but a Java API (Application programming interface.)
- The function of Java API is to document a standard framework fro dealing with data which may be tabular and generally relational data.
- The role of JDBC is just to act like wrapper to let us feed SQL requests to the server.

**What does JDBC do?**
- The first one is to establish a connection with a database.
- The second one to send SQL statements.
- And the last one is to process the results.
